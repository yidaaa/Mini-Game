		<h1> Yo listen up </h1>

		<p> 
		About a little guy that lives in a blue world.<br>
		And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue.<br>
		Like him, inside and outside.<br>
		Blue his house with a blue little window.<br>
		And a blue Corvette.<br>
		And everything is blue for him.<br>
		And himself and everybody around.<br>
		'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen.
		</p>

		<h2> This is his perspective... </h2>
		
		<p>
		I have a <b>BLUE</b> house with a <b>BLUE</b> window.<br>
		<b>BLUE</b> is the color of all that I wear.<br>
		<b>BLUE</b> are the streets and all the trees are too.<br>
		I have a girlfriend and she is so <b>BLUE</b>.<br>
		<b>BLUE</b> are the people here that walk around.<br>
		<b>BLUE</b> like my Corvette, it's in and outside.<br>
		<b>BLUE</b> are the words I say and what I think.<br>
		<b>BLUE</b> are the feelings that live inside me.
