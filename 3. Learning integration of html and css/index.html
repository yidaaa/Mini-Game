                Graphene, but better?

                Graphene is hailed as the wonder material of the 21st century. However, chemists from the University of California have discovered schwarzites, a new cousin of graphene that can also make leaps in the material-science world. Are you ready to jump on the schwarzite hype-train?

                From ancient inventions like iron to new-age discoveries like plastics and aluminum, materials literally change the way we live. The discovery of materials called semiconductors led to incredible inventions of telephones and radios, introducing new forms of communication which we could only dream of in the past. Just like how semiconductors made giant strides in technology and paved the way for the 20th century, the carbon family of graphene, nanotubes and fullerenes are expected to lead the world in the 21st century. 
                <br>
                Within the carbon family, graphene is the most popularized material. Graphene looks like a thin sheet of honeycomb made of carbon atoms. It may sound flimsy, but it’s quite the opposite. It’s just about the strongest, thinnest, lightest and best electrical-conductor we have ever come across. Its unique properties allow it to outperform many current materials. Graphene can replace the heavier copper-coating outside an airplane for better lightening resistance. Graphene-infused rubber and fabric can replace an airplane’s wheels and seats respectively for increased durability. By looking at an airplane alone, graphene’s applications are already plentiful. Despite already having multiple uses, scientists still have yet to discover the full potential of graphene!

                Joining graphene are two other carbon cousins, nanotubes and fullerenes. Nanotubes are graphene sheets rolled into cylinders, while fullerenes are graphene sheets transformed into spheres. Both have similar properties as graphene but takes on slightly different jobs due to their unique shapes. They are incredibly useful for building computer parts and storing energy, just to name a few. It’s not surprising that this carbon family will dominate our industries in the near future.
                <br>
                Currently, only two groups of carbons can be made: fullerenes and nanotubes with positive curvature and the flat graphene with no curvature. Chemists have always imagined a third group of carbon with negative curvature but had no way to make it. That is, until now.
            </p>

            <p class = "content">
                 Scientists from Japan and South Korea recently created 3 new carbon materials called zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs). Zeolites are crystalline forms of sand, commonly found in detergents as water softeners. Zeolites act as moulds for ZTCs and come in different structural forms. Just like how you would fill water into an ice tray, a zeolite ‘tray’ was filled with vaporised carbon to form ZTCs. A cube-shaped ice tray produces cube-shaped ice, and different zeolite structures produces different types of ZTCs. The scientists soon realised that these ZTCs have similar chemical properties to graphene, fullerenes and nanotubes. 
                 <br>
                 Unbeknownst to them, they created materials belonging to the third group of carbon – schwarzites. Recently this year, a team of chemists from UC Berkeley have managed to prove that those ZTCs structures are in fact schwarzites. Lead author and chemist Efrem Braun explained in an interview by Berkeley News that "these negatively-curved carbons have been very hard to synthesize on their own, but it turns out that you can grow the carbon film catalytically at the surface of a zeolite.”
                 <br>
                 Using computational programs for chemistry, the team virtually produced schwarzites using different zeolite-templates. Braun continued in his interview, “schwarzites synthesized to date have been made by choosing zeolite templates through trial and error. We provide very simple instructions you can follow to rationally make schwarzites and we show that, by choosing the right zeolite, you can tune schwarzites to optimize the properties you want.” Not only do they know how to make them, the team can optimize the templates to make ideally-shaped schwarzites.

            <p class = "content">
                Sure, we may be able to produce this material, but what exactly can it do? Also, why do we need schwarzites if we already have graphene?
            </p>

            <p class = "content">
                The bottom line is this: schwarzites are potentially more game-changing than the popularized graphene. Graphene has its limitations in certain areas, while schwarzites overcome them. In carbon-containing batteries, there must be an additional step to ‘force’ the flat, 2D graphene into 3D structures for the battery to work. However, schwarzites are already in 3D, making them better materials for battery production. Also, their hollow interior stores more energy, allowing schwarzite batteries to last even longer than graphene batteries. Apart from batteries, schwarzites have similar uses to its other cousins, such as capacitators and electrical components. 
                <br>
                After all the hype about schwarzites, it might be a little disappointing to say that they won’t be appearing in our markets anytime soon. Schwarzites have only been discovered less than a year ago. Its full potential has yet to be discovered. Even then, scientists still need to find ways to reduce its cost-production. Materials too expensive to produce will not be viable in the market. Even the revolutionary graphene, which was discovered more than 15 years ago, has yet to secure a strong foothold in our industries.

                15 years? If it’s such a revolutionary material, why did it take so long to be industrialized?
                <br>
                Actually, 15 years isn’t considered ‘long’. The first synthetic plastic was produced in 1907 but only became well-received in the 1960s. It took over 60 years for one of the most revolutionary materials in history to popularize! Also, graphene is slowly entering the market. Sales of G-Shoes with graphene-infused rubber soles and graphene-coated jackets started just last year. Samsung has also successfully produced the first ever graphene batteries recently and might even release it together with their upcoming Galaxy S10 smartphone next year!
                <br>
                Even though we won’t get to see the industrialisation of schwarzites anytime soon, it’s potential is something we should still be very, very excited about. With graphene already making its way into the market, schwarzites will slowly but surely join the leading carbon family of graphene, fullerenes and carbon-nanotubes. Let us embrace the coming of ‘The Carbon Age’!
