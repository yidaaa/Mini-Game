			Here's the story,<br>
			About a little guy that lives in a blue world.<br>
			And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue.<br>
			Like him, inside and outside.<br>
			Blue his house with a blue little window.<br>
			And a blue Corvette.<br>
			And everything is blue for him.<br>
			And himself and everybody around.<br>
			'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen.
