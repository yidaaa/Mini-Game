            It's finally 11pm... you better go back to hall.
            <br>
            It's been a long day and you're tired.
            <br>
            Still, you have yet to do your tutorials... but at least the night is still young.
            <br>
            Who needs sleep when you can study right?
            <br>
            3 a.m. is our usual sleep time anyway.
            <br>
            Congradulations! You've completed the game!
