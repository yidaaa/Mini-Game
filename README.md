This mini-game was created as a final project for a univeristy module, NM2207, in NUS.
Game was completed and uploaded in April 2019.

I documented the process in a 'diary' on the though process and coding process behind creating this game in this link:

My final project's write-up:

The 'Final Project' folder contains all the codes for creating this game. 
Other folders are assignments during the course that helped me learn and eventually complete this project.
